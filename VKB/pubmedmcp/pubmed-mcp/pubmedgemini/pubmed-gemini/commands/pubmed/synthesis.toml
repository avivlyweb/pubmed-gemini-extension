# Evidence Synthesis: {{args}}

## Evidence Summary
**Verdict:** [Use evidence_compass.verdict] | **Confidence:** [Use evidence_compass.confidence_level]
[Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of the evidence base, mentioning the total number of studies analyzed and the general consensus.]

## PICO Framework
- **Population:** [Describe the studied populations from pico_analysis]
- **Intervention:** [Describe the interventions from pico_analysis]
- **Comparison:** [Describe the comparisons from pico_analysis]
- **Outcomes:** [List primary outcomes mentioned in top_articles]

## Statistical Synthesis & Biomarkers
- **Biomarkers Identified:** [Scan top_articles for 'biomarkers' and list them, e.g., BDNF, CTSB, Cortisol]
- **Key Findings:** [Synthesize the 'statement' and 'effect_size' from top_articles. Be specific about percentages and p-values.]
- **Mechanisms:** [Explain how the identified biomarkers link to the observed outcomes based on study snapshots.]

## Study Quality Breakdown
| Study | Design | Grade | Trust Score | Key Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Author/Year] | [Design] | [Grade] | [Score]/100 | [Short summary of finding] |
*(List the top 5 articles from top_articles)*

## Contradictions & Explanations
[Use the 'contradiction_analysis' data to explain why some studies might disagree (e.g., population age, dosage, duration).]

## Clinical Impact Analysis
- **Who benefits most:** [Synthesize from population data and findings]
- **Optimal parameters:** [Synthesize dosage/duration/frequency if available]
- **MCID/Significance:** [Mention clinical vs statistical significance]

## Safety & Health Equity
- **Safety Profile:** [Mention any adverse events or risks identified]
- **Health Equity:** [Use the 'health_equity' data to discuss accessibility or demographic gaps]

## Knowledge Gaps
- [List 2-3 gaps identified in the research_gaps data]
