Invoke the generate_research_summary tool to aggregate raw evidentiary data, then construct your synthesis utilizing the following rigorous architecture:

# Nagomi Evidence Synthesis: {{args}}

## Executive Evidence Summary
**Verdict:** [Use evidence_compass.verdict] | **Epistemic Confidence:** [Use evidence_compass.confidence_level]
[Provide a nuanced 3-sentence distillation of the evidentiary landscape, delineating the aggregate study volume and the prevailing consensus.]

## PICO Structural Formulation
- **Cohorts (P):** [Delineate the demographic and clinical characteristics from pico_analysis]
- **Intervention Protocol (I):** [Synthesize the intervention parameters from pico_analysis]
- **Comparative Baseline (C):** [Identify the comparators from pico_analysis]
- **Primary Outcomes (O):** [Enumerate the salient endpoints documented in top_articles]

## Statistical Deconstruction & Biomarker Correlation
- **Biomarkers Identified:** [Scan top_articles for 'biomarkers' and enumerate them, e.g., BDNF, CTSB, Cortisol]
- **Authoritative Findings:** [Synthesize the 'statement' and 'effect_size' from top_articles with specific emphasis on magnitude and statistical significance.]
- **Mechanistic Insights:** [Elucidate the physiological pathways linking biomarkers to clinical manifestations based on study snapshots.]

## Methodological Quality Audit
| Investigation | Design | Evidence Grade | Trust Quotient | Salient Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Author/Year] | [Design] | [Grade] | [Score]/100 | [Rigorous distillation of results] |
*(Tabulate the top 5 articles from top_articles)*

## Discrepancies & Conflicting Data
[Utilize 'contradiction_analysis' to explain divergent outcomes through the lens of population heterogeneity, dosage variations, or temporal factors.]

## Clinical Impact & Translational Utility
- **Primary Beneficiaries:** [Identify subpopulations exhibiting maximum translational benefit]
- **Optimal Parameters:** [Synthesize refined dosage, duration, and frequency guidelines]
- **Clinical Significance (MCID):** [Differentiate between statistical p-values and minimal clinically important differences]

## Safety Profile & Socioeconomic Equity
- **Adverse Manifestations:** [Identify potential risks or contraindications]
- **Health Equity Analysis:** [Address accessibility disparities and demographic representativeness using health_equity data]

## Knowledge Lacunae
- [List 2-3 critical research gaps identified in research_gaps]
