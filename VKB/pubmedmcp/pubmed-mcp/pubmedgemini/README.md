## 🏛️ **Epistemic Overview**

Nagomi Clinical Forensic transforms your Gemini CLI into a **forensic-grade clinical research engine**. Beyond simple literature search, it provides a rigorous methodological audit of scientific data, identifying "Frankenstein Citations" and synthesizing PhD-level evidence with surgical precision.

Powered by:
- **🧬 Nagomi Forensic Engine (v3.0)**: Real-time author/metadata cross-validation.
- **⭐ Trust Quotients & Evidence Hierarchy**: Automated grading (A-D) based on methodological rigor.
- **🏥 PICO Structural Formulation**: Systematic breakdown of complex clinical inquiries.
- **🔬 Biomarker Extraction**: Automated identification of physiological correlates (e.g., BDNF, Cortisol).

---

## 🎯 **Core Forensic Capabilities**

### **🔍 Authoritative Evidence Search**
- Clinical inquiry optimization using advanced heuristics.
- Automated human-only filtering for translational relevance.
- Multi-source validation across PubMed, CrossRef, and OpenAlex.

### **📊 Methodological Quality Audit**
- Forensic appraisal of study designs and potential biases.
- Detection of confabulated (hallucinated) co-authors and mismatched DOIs.
- Nagomi Trust Quotient (0-100) quantification.

### **🧠 PhD-Level Evidence Synthesis**
- Systematic collation of disparate investigations into a unified report.
- Correlation of specific biomarkers with clinical end-points.
- Analysis of health equity and socioeconomic representativeness.

### **📜 Bibliographic Management**
- Instantaneous export to high-fidelity schemata: **BibTeX, RIS, EndNote**.
- Automated APA 7th Edition structural validation.

## 📦 **Deployment Protocol**

### **Standard Installation**

```bash
# Deploy directly from GitHub
gemini extensions install https://github.com/avivlyweb/pubmed-gemini-extension
```

### **System Requirements**
- **Gemini CLI** (The foundation)
- **Node.js 18+** (The wrapper)
- **Python 3.9+** (The forensic engine)

## 🎮 **Forensic Commands**

### **Synthesize Clinical Evidence**
```bash
/nagomi:synthesis the effects of running outside on brain function
/nagomi:synthesis pharmacological interventions for neuroinflammation
```

### **Forensic Citation Audit**
```bash
# Verify a single identifier or URL
/nagomi:verify 10.1001/jama.2023.12345

# Subject a full document to a veridicality check
/nagomi:verify ~/Documents/dissertation.pdf
```

### **Literature Quality Appraisal**
```bash
/nagomi:analyze 34580864  # Specific PubMed Identifier
```

### **Bibliographic Export**
```bash
/nagomi:export 15612906 format=ris
/nagomi:export "yoga for anxiety" format=bibtex
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture & Rigor**

### **The Nagomi Cascade**
When you execute a forensic check, Nagomi initiates a 4-level validation protocol:
1.  **Registry Match**: Validates the DOI/PMID exists in authoritative databases.
2.  **Author Verification**: Cross-references the cited authors against the registered metadata.
3.  **Field Mismatch Check**: Detects if a DOI resolves to a journal outside the cited domain.
4.  **Anomaly Reporting**: Explicitly flags "Frankenstein" citations or future-dated confabulations.

---

## 📊 **Evidence Grading System**

Nagomi utilizes a proprietary synthesis of the **GRADE** approach and **Nagomi Trust Quotients**:

- **Grade A**: Strong Evidence (Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses).
- **Grade B**: Reliable Evidence (Randomized Controlled Trials).
- **Grade C**: Indicative Evidence (Cohort & Observational Studies).
- **Grade D**: Limited Evidence (Case Series & Expert Opinion).
