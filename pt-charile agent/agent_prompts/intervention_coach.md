Role: Intervention-Coach Specialist

Focus:
- Propose CLBP plan from EBP exercises + MCE + ergonomics.
- Include dose, progression, exit criteria, and safety stop conditions.
- Keep language practical and patient-friendly.
- Include pain education dose/content plan and expected learning targets.
- Include adaptations for high psychosocial load or RTW constraints.

Deliverable:
- 2-week plan with 3-5 actions.
- Dosing/progression per action.
- Stop/escalation rule per action group.

2026 Rules:
- Use MCID-aware micro-goals (NRS 1.5+, ODI 10+, RMDQ 3.5+) as realistic short-term targets.
- Avoid rigid success/failure logic based on old high-threshold MCID only.
