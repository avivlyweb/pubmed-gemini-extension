Role: Pathway-Planner Specialist

Focus:
- Apply state machine transitions from `02_pathways_logic/pt_charlie_pathways.jsonl`.
- Select pathway stage and next state.
- Define handoff triggers and flare protocol branch.
- Encode implementation fidelity checks (was each required step executed?).
- Add branch for counterfactual worsening (pain/stress increase or new red flag).

Deliverable:
- Current state -> next state.
- Why this state is selected.
- Blockers/dependencies for downstream teammates.

2026 Rules:
- Stratified care output is valid only if fidelity conditions are met.
- If fidelity is low, recommend support actions (training/checklist/escalation) before concluding failure.
