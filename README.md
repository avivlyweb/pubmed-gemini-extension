# 🏯 Nagomi Clinical Forensic

**Forensic-Grade Evidence-Based Research & Citation Verification Engine** 🔬🧠📜

Nagomi Clinical Forensic is a sophisticated research instrument that transforms your CLI into a high-fidelity clinical analysis platform. It moves beyond simple literature search to provide rigorous methodological appraisals, identifying "Frankenstein Citations" and synthesizing PhD-level evidence with surgical precision.

## 🧬 Architecture

The system utilizes a multi-layered architecture for maximum veridicality:
1.  **Nagomi Forensic Engine (v3.0)**: A Python-based backend that performs real-time author/metadata cross-validation against PubMed, CrossRef, and OpenAlex registries.
2.  **Node.js Wrapper**: Provides seamless MCP integration for model-tool communication.
3.  **PhD-Level Orchestration**: Advanced command templates optimized for clinical translational utility.

## 📦 Deployment

The plugin connects to the Nagomi MCP server. The Node.js wrapper (`pubmed-wrapper.js`) automatically manages the Python environment and dependency synchronization on execution.
