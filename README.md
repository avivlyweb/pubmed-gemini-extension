## New in v2.8 - Enhanced Verification & Actionable Reports

### Multi-Source DOI Verification

DOIs that fail initial checks are now verified against multiple sources:

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **doi.org** | Primary DOI resolution check |
| **CrossRef API** | Direct metadata lookup |
| **OpenAlex** | Free, comprehensive academic database |
| **Europe PMC** | European papers and preprints |

### Frankenstein Detection

Catches "Frankenstein references" - fake citations that combine real DOIs with fabricated metadata:

```
🚨 [13] DEFINITE_FAKE
  "Hao, J. et al. (2025). Biomechanical analysis of PAP..."
  
  📍 Problem:
     • DOI mismatch: Claims "Annals of Biomedical Engineering" 
       but DOI points to "Quality & Safety in Health Care"
     • Title similarity: 12% (threshold: 60%)
  
  ✏️  What to do:
     REMOVE or REPLACE this reference immediately.
     → Search Google Scholar for the correct citation.
```

### Title Similarity Threshold

- Uses `rapidfuzz` for fast, accurate title matching
- References must have ≥60% title similarity to claimed DOI metadata
- Below threshold → flagged as potential Frankenstein

### Actionable Advice

Every flagged reference now includes:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Problem** | What's wrong with this reference |
| **What to do** | Specific action to take |
| **Verify here** | Direct links to Google Scholar, CrossRef |

### PDF Table Filtering (v2.8.1)

Improved PDF parsing to filter out table content that was incorrectly extracted as references:

- Detects statistical values (p-values, CIs, ORs)
- Filters percentage and fraction patterns
- Validates minimum reference characteristics (length, author pattern, year)

— — —

## New in v2.7 - Reference Verification (Fake Citation Detector)

### Catch AI-Hallucinated References

With the rise of AI-generated academic papers, fake references are becoming a serious problem. This tool verifies citations against real databases:

```
You: /pubmed:verify path/to/paper.pdf

Gemini: Analyzing 74 references...

VERIFICATION SUMMARY
════════════════════════════════════════
Total References:  74
✅ Verified:       24 (32.4%)
🚨 Definite Fake:   5 (6.8%)
⚠️  Suspicious:     23 (31.1%)
❌ Not Found:      17 (23.0%)
ℹ️  Likely Valid:    5 (6.8%)

FLAGGED REFERENCES:
[3] 🚨 DEFINITE_FAKE - Doe, J. et al. (2025)
    → Future publication date - impossible
    → Verify manually: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=...
[7] ❌ NOT_FOUND - Sample, A.B. et al. (2022)
    → DOI does not resolve: 10.0000/fake.example.001

LIKELY VALID (but not in databases):
[15] ℹ️ "Expert Systems with Applications paper..."
    → Not in PubMed but found in CrossRef - non-medical journal

LIMITATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────
• PubMed primarily indexes biomedical literature
• Non-medical journals may show false 'Not Found' results
• 🚨 DEFINITE_FAKE = high confidence fake (future dates, DOI→wrong field)
• ℹ️ LIKELY_VALID = probably real but outside our database coverage
• Always verify flagged references manually before drawing conclusions
```

### Confidence Tiers

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 🚨 **DEFINITE_FAKE** | 100% certain fake (future dates, DOI points to wrong field) | Remove citation |
| ❌ **NOT_FOUND** | Not in any database, no good match | Verify manually |
| ⚠️ **SUSPICIOUS** | Partial match, some discrepancies | Review carefully |
| ℹ️ **LIKELY_VALID** | Not in PubMed but appears legitimate (non-medical journal) | Probably OK |
| ✅ **VERIFIED** | Found in databases, good match | Confirmed real |

### What Gets Checked

| Check | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **PubMed Lookup** | Searches 35M+ articles for author/title matches |
| **DOI Resolution** | Verifies DOI actually resolves (with retry logic) |
| **CrossRef Validation** | Cross-references against CrossRef database |
| **Year Verification** | Flags future dates or year mismatches |
| **Field Detection** | Identifies non-medical journals to reduce false positives |
| **APA Style** | Checks APA 7th Edition formatting |

### Quick Verification

Check a single DOI or PMID instantly:

```
You: /pubmed:verify https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12373

Gemini: ✅ VERIFIED (100% confidence)
  Title: "Nanometre-scale thermometry in a living cell"
  Found in: PubMed, CrossRef
  DOI resolves: Yes
```

### APA 7th Edition Style Check

The tool also validates reference formatting against APA 7th Edition rules:

| Rule | What Gets Checked |
|------|-------------------|
| **Author format** | Last, F. M. (inverted, with initials) |
| **Year format** | (2023). (in parentheses, followed by period) |
| **Title case** | Sentence case for articles (not Title Case) |
| **DOI format** | https://doi.org/10.xxxx (not doi: or dx.doi.org) |
| **Ampersand** | Use & not "and" between authors |
| **No et al.** | List all authors in reference list |

### Supported Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | Extracts references section automatically |
| Word | `.docx` | Parses document text |
| Text | `.txt` | Raw reference list |
| Direct | DOI/PMID/URL | Quick single-reference check |

### Real-World Example

We tested this on a retracted paper that was flagged for AI-generated content:

- **Result:** 67.6% of references were problematic
- **Multiple references** could not be found in any database
- **Several references** cited impossible future publication dates
- **DOI mismatches** - some DOIs pointed to papers in completely different fields

The tool successfully identified fabricated citations that human reviewers missed.

## New in v2.5 - Key Findings & Contradiction Explainer

### See the Numbers That Matter

Every study now shows the **actual statistical results**:

```
KEY FINDING:
  Statement: "Yoga significantly reduced anxiety scores compared to waitlist control"
  Direction: POSITIVE
  Effect Size: SMD = 0.77 (medium effect)
  P-value: p < 0.001
  95% CI: [0.52, 1.02]
  Practical Significance: MEDIUM
```

**What gets extracted:**
| Metric | Example | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Effect Size | SMD=0.77, 34% reduction, OR=0.65 | How big is the effect? |
| P-value | p<0.001, p=0.03 | Is it statistically significant? |
| Confidence Interval | 95% CI [0.52, 1.02] | How precise is the estimate? |
| Practical Significance | Large/Medium/Small | Does it matter clinically? |

### Why Do Studies Disagree?

When evidence conflicts, you now get an **explanation**:

```
CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS:
  Conflicting results: 8 studies support, 3 oppose

  Key Differences Identified:
  - Intervention Dose: Supporting studies: 4000 IU/day. Opposing: 400 IU/day
  - Study Duration: Supporting studies: 24 weeks. Opposing: 8 weeks
  - Population Age: Supporting: elderly (≥65). Opposing: adults 30-50

  SYNTHESIS: The conflicting results suggest that dose may be critical 
  for effectiveness, and longer treatment periods may be needed.
```

### Instant Article Understanding

Every article now comes with a **2-sentence AI snapshot**:

## Pro Tips

### 1. Use Natural Language
Instead of keywords, ask questions:
```
Does meditation reduce cortisol levels in stressed adults?
```

### 2. Be Specific About Population
```
yoga anxiety in elderly       # Better
yoga anxiety                   # Good
yoga                          # Too broad
```

### 3. Check Open Access First
Look for articles with `open_access: true` - you can read the full text immediately!

### 4. Trust the Weighted Score
If 5 case reports say "no" but 1 meta-analysis says "yes", the weighted score correctly favors the meta-analysis.

### 5. Export While You Research
```
/pubmed:synthesis your topic
# Review the results, then:
Export those top 5 articles to RIS format
```
